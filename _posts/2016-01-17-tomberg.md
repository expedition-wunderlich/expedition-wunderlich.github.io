Bruno Tomberg on disainer ja õppejõud, üks Eesti disainihariduse rajajaid, Eesti Kunstiakadeemia emeriitprofessor. 1966. aastal pandi tema initsiatiivil alus ERKI tööstuskunsti kateedrile, tänasele disainiteaduskonnale, kust on poole sajandi jooksul välja kasvanud mitu põlvkonda Eesti tootedisainereid. Samuti kutsus Tomberg ellu näitustesarja „Ruum ja vorm“. Eesti tekstiilikunsti on ta tugevalt mõjutanud omas ajas moodsate vaibakavanditega.

Bruno Tomberg is a designer and an instructor, one of the foundation-layers of Estonian design education, and a Professor Emeritus at the Estonian Academy of Arts (EAA). The groundwork for the State Art Institute of the Estonian SSR’s Department of Industrial Art was done at his initiative – today, this is the EAA Faculty of Design, which has trained several generations of Estonian product designers over the course of half a century. Tomberg was also responsible for bringing to life the “Space and Form” exhibition series. Throughout his career, Tomberg has strongly impacted Estonian textile art with his rug designs.

### Interview. {{ page.title }} (excerpts)

#### 0.19-1.20

I was very good at drawing and painting. You know, when your aunties and uncles come to visit and ask: “And what will become of the little one?” I would always get angry at this because I never had this grand dream of becoming a pilot or a chimneysweep. I always knew that I would become a painter. So I always answered, angrily, that I would become a painter. I nearly did become one, because I really was good at drawing, and painting too. And to this day I can remember [my mother’s] words: “Most painters are poor as church mice. They have jobs and, if they have a lot of talent, they do art on the side. There are very few artists who can make a living and feed their families off their art.”

#### 7.24-7.48

I think that a man should be able to remain honest in front of himself: to avoid lying to oneself, creating personal illusions. But the path to acquiring this clarity of vision, distinguishing between fact and illusion – this is difficult.

#### 10.20-10.37

The thing that I miss the most is taking walks in the forest. Throughout my life, the forest has been my cathedral. And I cannot go and pick mushrooms, this is a great failing indeed.
